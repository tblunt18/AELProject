			          <p>This is a book about  Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). We focus on AR and VR not as technologies, but as part of our complex digital media culture. This perspective has determined what to include and what to omit. Our aim is to show how AR and VR function as media and serve as platforms for existing and new forms of expression, rather than to account fully for their varied history and present usage. We will describe how AR and VR relate to and remediate other, more established media such as film, television and games.</p>
			          <br>
			          <p> Both the printed book and its digital companion are addressed to those who want to understand augmented and virtual reality as media. We consider where AR and VR come from, how they function, and how they have come to take a place among the many media channels and platforms that exist today. This requires some consideration of their technical as well as historical and cultural contexts, but neither the printed book nor the digital companion delve deeply into the technologies per se. Those who want to learn how to design and implement AR and VR applications or to seek a thorough treatment of computer graphics, tracking technologies, and computer vision will need to look elsewhere. We limit our discussion of technical details to the ones that are most important for situating AR and VR in the particular media tradition that we are identifying, the tradition of what we are calling reality media.  And we strongly believe that both design and technical development can benefit from understanding AR and VR as reality media. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text">In January 1896 an audience in a basement room of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films shown was The Arrival of the Train at la Ciotat Station. All that happens in the approximately 50-second film is that a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. As the train comes closer, some in the audience panic. Imagining that the train is going to burst out of the screen into the room, they leave their seats and rush for the door... They were astonished, not fooled, and what astonished them was that moving images could seem so real. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" >Let’s reimagine that scene in VR. Seated in your living room at home, you put on your VR headset and are transported back to that hall in the Grand Café. You can look all around you at the other spectators. You can turn all the way around and see the back of the hall. All of these are rendered in realistic 3D graphics. The Arrival of the Train at La Ciotat Station begins to play on the screen. When the train approaches, the shiny engine bursts through the screen into the hall and comes to a stop among scattered chairs. The 3D spectators jump up and have managed to get out of the way.

	        		<p class="white-text" >VR and AR are among the latest additions to our complex media culture, which still includes everything from books and magazines to paintings, radio, television, and film—all competing for attention and status. In that competition the producers and promoters of each form promise an experience that is unique and, in some way, better than other media—more compelling, more authentic, truer to life. We noted that Hollywood has been making movies about VR since the 1990s and that popular conceptions of VR have been formed by such movies more than by the experience of VR itself. Far more people have seen Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster, Ready Player One (2018), and experienced VR in a film format rather than in an Oculus or Vive headset. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" > Richard Rushton (2011) described the experience that film, in general, offers its audience as “filmic reality.” Filmic reality, Rushton wrote, is the process by which films become part of how we understand our lives and our world. It does not matter whether these objects could exist outside in today’s physical world; they are real within the context of the film in which they appear. In this spirit, we could say that Ready Player One is the filmic reality of virtual reality. This film, along with others from Lawnmower Man to The Matrix and beyond, has played an outsized role in shaping our culture’s perception of the potentials and the dangers of the actual technology of VR in our world. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text">Even a few years ago, relatively few people had experienced Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) because the required hardware was expensive and the software difficult to use. Now several million VR headsets are shipped each year from various manufacturers—Sony PlayStation, Oculus, HTC, and others (Statista 2019). Many gamers have experienced VR versions of role-playing games, construction games, driving games, sports games, or first-person shooters such as Valve’s Half Life Alyx. Games such as Half Life Alyx and Minecraft Earth show what VR and AR offer today for consumers. Let’s consider briefly how the two technologies got to this point in their development. </p>

	        	<div class="scrollItem" >
	        		<p class="white-text" > The development of AR and VR as computer-based technologies is generally said to begin with the work of the graphics pioneer Ivan Sutherland, who constructed the first responsive, head-mounted system in the late 1960s (Sutherland 1968). In one of its modes, Sutherland’s headset was suspended from the ceiling by a mechanical boom in order to track the user’s head movements: hence, its nickname: “the Sword of Damocles.”  The system displayed a wire-frame object floating in the room in front of the user. It relied on see-through optics, which employed half-silvered mirrors to enable the user to see the physical room itself as well as the virtual object that the computer was drawing. When the user turned her head, the object remained in place. The Sword of Damocles is often considered the first VR headset, but today we would more accurately call it AR. At that time, the technology (both the hardware and the software) was not capable of constructing a complete graphic world. VR was out of the question, although it was certainly one of the goals.

	        	<div class="scrollItem" >
	        		<p class="white-text" > AR and VR have developed for decades along separate paths, and AR and VR headsets remain fundamentally different. Compare the Oculus Quest with the Magic Leap (figure 1.4). The Magic Leap looks like a pair of goggles; the user who puts on the VR Quest essentially has a box in front of her eyes. Although both systems rely on computer graphics to draw virtual objects, the technologies for displaying them differ significantly. VR has two sets of optics, one for each eye, that together produce a wide continuous field of view (often about 110 degrees at present). An AR device uses one of two techniques for combining the view of the physical world with what the computer draws: video-mix or see-through optics. Video-mix optics takes a video of the world and mixes the computer graphics in. This is how smartphones do it, since they have one or more cameras on the back anyway.</p>

				<div class="scrollItem" >
	        		<p class="white-text" > The software and the hardware for VR and AR continue to evolve and converge. New phones include multiple cameras or even depth cameras, which together with computer vision software make surface detection and eventually scene understanding possible. There are inexpensive stand-alone VR headsets as well as enclosures that allow you to convert your phone into a makeshift VR device. Some VR headsets are equipped with forward-looking cameras, which makes them capable of video-mixed AR, although a high-quality multipurpose AR-VR headset still lies far in the future. Even without a headset, the same app on a smartphone may jump between AR and a form of “pan-and-scan” VR. The Milgram and Kishino reality-virtuality continuum accommodates this convergence. The authors listed only four principal points, the real environment and three XR technologies (AR, AV, and VR), but they described a host of configurations of visual displays even in the 1990s.  </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" > Around 2015, both VR and AR entered a new phase, in which the connection between the physical and virtual worlds is becoming both deeper and broader. The visual connection is becoming deeper because of advances in computer vision. The world the computer sees through its camera(s) is no longer always flat. Desktop computers, headsets, and even smartphones running computer vision algorithms are now beginning to see into the world: to detect surfaces and identify the shape and volume of objects in space. And detecting surfaces, such as the floor, tables, and walls, is a first step to understanding the scene as a whole. Complete scene understanding means that tables, chairs, animals, and people are no longer just colored pixels on the surface of the camera’s sensor chip. Computer vision algorithms combine that data with data from the smartphone’s or headset’s motion to analyze the tables, chairs, and people as three-dimensional objects and to organize those objects into a scene.   </p>

	        		<p class="white-text">It was in Italy in the fifteenth century that architects and painters developed the system of linear perspective in practice and in theory (Edgerton 2009). Their techniques drew from the science of optics that was part of the developing Scientific Revolution. Linear perspective was believed to make a painting as realistic as possible because it imitated the way rays of light reflected off objects in the world and focused on a surface. In other words, linear perspective was supposed to capture the way we “really” see the world. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" >At the end of the eighteenth century, a Scotsman named Robert Barker employed perspective painting to create a related form, for which he coined the name panorama. Barker’s panoramas were fully immersive trompe-l’oeil buildings, virtual environments consisting of a painted canvas stretched all the way around a rotunda. The viewers stood on a platform in the middle and saw the vast painted scene in whichever direction they looked (except on the ceiling, but the roof of the building was designed to emit diffused daylight to support the illusion.) In 1793, Barker built a panoramic theater in London’s Leicester Square. For three shillings, Londoners could experience a 360º view of their own city as if they were standing at the top of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which was in fact only two miles away.</p>

	        		<p class="white-text" >While the panoramic exhibition is an almost forgotten reality medium of the nineteenth century, two others from that period, photography and film, continue to have a defining place in our media culture. Photography developed through mechanizing the process of linear perspective. Already in the eighteenth century, the camera obscura had been used to focus light on a surface at the back of the box or on to a mirror that reflected the image up for viewing. The image in a camera obscura was ephemeral, until the development of modern chemistry that made another medium possible. The myth of photographic reality, an early version of the la Ciotat myth, was almost immediately born.  </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" >In the final decades of the nineteenth century, inventors were working on various mechanisms to lend the illusion of motion to sequences of static images, among them the zoetrope, the praxinoscope, and the phenakistoscope. In the 1890s, the Lumière brothers added another to the list, the cinématographe, which is now recognized as one of the first fully successful film cameras and projectors. It is the device that produced, for example, The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, described in the Introduction. The arrival of that train in a small town on the Côte d’Azur announced the arrival of a reality medium that depended on and at the same time enhanced the authenticity of photography. Although the early black-and-white films were overexposed and jerky (recorded at 16 to 20 frames per second), they succeeded in reproducing a facet of reality that still photography could not.</p>

Unlike true VR, 360° videos (also called VR videos or VR movies) are not generated in real time. Just as traditional movies consist of a set of photographic images shown at a rate of 24 or 30 frames per second, a 360° video consists of a set of panoramic images, each of which is an equirectangular projection. Each image is displayed for only a fraction of a second and then replaced by the next one. The result is the same illusion of motion that we get when we watch a flat video on a digital screen. </p>

Here is a timeline for the media we have discussed.As each new reality medium appeared, it borrowed from earlier media, while at the same time claiming to improve upon its predecessors. Renaissance painting used techniques of linear perspective to make the image realistic from a particular viewpoint. But a painted canvas on the wall was only convincing if the viewer did not look beyond the frame. The trompe l’oeil painting pushed the idea of perspective illusion further by situating the painting on a wall or ceiling to look like an extension of the architecture itself. A painted panorama was a trompe l’oeil extended in 360º. Photography remediated perspective painting in a different way by bypassing the painter, and film remediated photography by adding motion.

	        		<p class="white-text"> The first step in achieving photorealism in computer graphics lies in reproducing the perspective in which we see the world. When we look at the world, objects that are far away appear smaller than ones that are close, and straight lines converge in a particular way. Ancient Greek and Roman painters had experimented with perspective, but as we noted in Chapter 2, it was Renaissance painters beginning with Brunelleschi in the fifteenth century who developed systematic techniques for drawing in linear perspective in order to create the illusion of three dimensions on their flat canvases.</p>

	        		<p class="white-text" > The term photorealism has been used for decades to designate visual experience as it is captured in static form by the photographic camera and in moving form by the film camera. Ever since Ivan Sutherland began to experiment with CG in the 1960s, one of the key goals of the work has been photorealism. Each advance in projection, lighting, and shading was measured by how much closer it brought CG to making an image indistinguishable from a photograph, an animation indistinguishable from live-action film. And close is not good enough. The CG world (gamers and critics as well as designers and computer researchers) speak of the uncanny valley—a term coined in 1970 by the roboticist, Masahiro Mori, specifically to describe robots that look or act in ways similar to but not indistinguishable from humans. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" > Although photorealism has been the holy grail of computer graphics since its inception, this is not to say that all computer graphics aim exclusively at photorealism. Computer graphics can also be used to create scenes and whole worlds that look and act differently from the ones we see in photographs or live-action films. One of the vaunted appeals of VR is that it can free developers to reimagine the world. The VR pioneer Jaron Lanier likes to say that in VR you can become anything you want—a dragon, for example, or a teapot. One of his definitions of VR is “...a medium that could convey dreaming”. In AR experiences as well, designers try to blend computer graphics seamlessly with the user’s view of the real world or allow those graphics to stand out and become visually distinct.  </p>

				<div class="scrollItem" >
	        		<p class="white-text" > The Marvel and Transformer films remind us that computer graphics can be used in hybrid representations that does not aim at seamless integration. Most AR applications fall in this category when they overlay computer graphics onto a view of the physical world.  It is in some ways even harder to achieve a photorealistic blending of computer graphics and the physical environment in AR than it is to build a world from scratch in VR, and most AR experiences do not even try, but instead, present us with two clearly distinguishable layers of the virtual and physical. The tradition of layering animation into live action dates much further back—to the period not long after live-action film was invented. In 1914, the animator Winsor McCay introduced a filmgoing public to the idea of animation in the film Gertie the Dinosaur. This was a live-action film featuring McCay and his friends and showing how he drew the thousands of frames needed to animate Gertie. </p>

Every computer-generated world in VR is a stand-in for the physical world that we have left behind when we put on a headset. Which brings us back to the uncanny valley and the quest for photorealism. As we noted above, the standard view in computer graphics is that the uncanny valley is a place the users do not want to visit. They want to remain in the land of cartoon-like graphics or eventually to jump over the uncanny valley into perfect photorealism, which would mean making characters and landscapes that are indistinguishable doubles of the real world.</p>

        		<p class="white-text">Chapter 3 was about the space that computer graphics constructs; this one is about finding the user of an AR or VR system in space. The two questions here are: where is the user in the world (spatial tracking) and what is the world like around the user (spatial sensing)? The first is the key to making an AR or VR experience responsive. The user can effectively look around and move through the space of the experience, only if the computer can keep track of where she is and where she is looking. The second question is the key to a new set of AR (and potentially VR) applications. Improved cameras and software for computer vision make it possible for mobile devices to “understand” the world that the cameras see. Applications begin to see into the world, marking surfaces such as floors and walls in three dimensions and eventually being able to distinguish furniture, humans, and all the other objects the room contains.</p>

You are led to a physical black pillar in which indentations simulate the curves of a hole in a giant sequoia tree. This is Treehugger: Wawona, an interactive VR installation created by London-based creative studio, Marshmallow Laser Feast. What you see in VR space is the giant tree: “As you touch the trunk of the enormous tree, you can feel the edges of a knot in the bark. If you lean your head into it, your vision passes through the surface of the virtual sequoia. Inside, you can see the tree’s xylem pump water from the ground up through its trunk. Then you begin to levitate, following the flow of water towards the canopy. Looking down is disorientating, so you cling to the physical surface of the tree.” (McMullan 2016). Treehugger: Wawona is a perceptually rich experience that transports you to the forests of giant redwood and sequoia trees on the West coast of the United States. Treehugger: Wawona has been described as strange, psychedelic, and disorientating.</p>

Returning to the first definition, the feeling of being there, we could say that AR always generates presence, because the user is never cut off from the physical world, as she is in VR. If you are experiencing AR on your smartphone, the physical world is there for you to see just beyond the screen. When you wear a headset such as HoloLens 2, you may feel more enclosed, but you still look through the eyepieces at the surrounding world. Your sense of being in the world is hardly compromised. Presence also figures differently in different kinds of AR experiences, as the following examples illustrate. </p>

The Google Maps AR will work anywhere, but it gives directions specifically based on where you are.

Branded as VR, The Displaced was in fact a 360° video documentary. This genre is growing. Indeed, an online database of both 360° videos and 3D VR contains over 600 examples to the end of 2018. In addition to 360° documentaries, there are experiments in documentary film in 3D VR. The documentarian Nonny de la Peña has worked for years in this area. Along with a collaborator Peggy Weil, she remediated her own film documentary Unconstitutional: The War on Our Civil Liberties (2004) into a first-person experience Gone Gitmo (2007).

Museums and heritage sites are committed to bridging the gaps between now and then or here and there— bringing the past into the present or bringing what is physically distant into the visitor’s presence. If you are standing on the Acropolis in Athens, you see in front of you the ruins of the Parthenon, the temple to the patron goddess Athena, and other temples and buildings, such as the Erechtheum and the Propylaea, You have to imagine what the whole hill looked like in 400 B.C. If you are standing in the British Museum in London, looking at the Elgin marbles, you see fragmentary sculptures that were once part of the Parthenon, 1500 miles away. That distance has historical, cultural, and political implications. AR and VR cannot do anything to solve the political dispute between the U.K. and Greece, but they can reunite sites and artifacts virtually, in both time and place. </p>

It is ironic, then, that the early uses of VR environments include viewing traditional films or playing screen-based video games. Launching the Windows Mixed Reality system, for example, conducts you to a villa on a mountaintop. There you find a giant screen, which is your portal to surfing the web or watching videos of movies and television series. It surprised (and dismayed) many when Facebook bought Oculus in 2014, even before the startup company had released a production version of its VR headset. Facebook saw VR as an opportunity to remediate social media and subsequently developed Spaces to add to the universe of platforms (from watches to smartphones to tablets to computers) for social interactions.</p>

Director Brett Leonard has said that one of the key differences between ordinary filmmaking and 360° is that we are visitors to these worlds, part of a “storyworlding”. Unlike the avatars that stand in for you in VR or computer graphics worlds (think of massively multiplayer online role-playing games like World of Warcraft or the virtual world Second Life), these environments promise an experience of being inside a cinematic world. 360° videos often seek to delete all traces of the camera gear from the film. When you look down in Man on Spire (Chin and Solomon 2016) which shows filmmaker and mountain climber Jimmy Chin’s ascent to the top of 1 World Trade Center, you do not see a body to whom the viewpoint belongs. The camera rig is effaced from the film, so that you see only the dizzying view of Manhattan below. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text"> In 1946, the film historian André Bazin wrote an essay entitled “The Myth of Total Cinema,” in which he considered what the “final and complete form” of cinema would be (Bazin 2004 18). What did cinema want ultimately to become? In this chapter we will pose that question for AR and in the next chapter for VR: What are the myths of total AR and VR? We can trace the myth of total AR at least back to 1991, to what now seems to be the paleolithic phase of the digital age, David Gelertner published Mirror Worlds, or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox... How It Will Happen and What It Will Mean, forecasting the future integration of our physical and digital worlds. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" >None of the AR clouds may contain the whole world, but the larger ones will still be a plenitude, an almost inexhaustible store of data. And this is the second reason why each mirror that reflects that data will be partial. Whether there are dozens of small clouds or a single comprehensive database, the user would never want to view all the information at one time. The data would need to be filtered, or it would be overwhelming. A vision of AR gone wild was provided by Keiichi Matsuda’s 2016 video Hyperreality, in which the AR Cloud descends upon and literally clouds the vision of its users. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text">Bazin’s myth of total cinema was the idea that cinema aspired to be “a total and complete representation of reality… the reconstruction of a perfect illusion of the outside world in sound, color, and relief” (2004, 19). We are arguing that in effect the corresponding myths of total AR and VR each represent variations or remediations of Bazin’s myth for cinema. For AR the myth of the mirror world envisions the complete digital reconstruction of our lived world. For VR the myth envisions the perfect 3D illusion of a perfect 3D world, which may or may not resemble the world we live in. In 1992, Neal Stephenson published Snow Crash, a sci-fi novel that takes place largely in what he called “the Metaverse”—a virtual space consisting of a single road, 100 meters wide and over 65000 km long, spanning the circumference of a virtual planet. Stephenson’s Metaverse was a 3D strip mall, where anyone with the wherewithal could purchase lots and erect virtual buildings. For those who could afford the goggles, the Metaverse became a fully immersive experience, inhabited by millions of avatars—both bots and human users.  </p>

	        		<p class="white-text" > MMORPG (Massively Multiple Online Role-Playing Games) began to appear in the second half of the 1990s and to thrive in the 2000s. Just as screen-based 3D games themselves sparked in players’ minds the desire for a more immersive experience provided by VR headsets, playing MMORPGs whetted the appetite for social experiences in VR. Players could now dream of participating in quests with fellow players in a fully immersive, virtual world. But when in March 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of the VR startup Oculus, the gaming community reacted with concern and uncertainty. Oculus was poised to give gamers the immersive platform that they had been hoping for. And yet Facebook was already a mammoth corporation, and even though the scandals of Cambridge Analytica and fake news were a few years off, the company that made its billions by monetizing its customers’ data, seemed to have little understanding of gamer culture. </p>

	        		<p class="white-text">AR and VR are unique among reality media in the way that they configure the user’s relationship to space. Their spaces are not only dynamic but responsive to the user’s movements and in some cases active interventions. Vuforia’s app Chalk illustrates the power of AR in this respect, but also suggests the challenge to individual privacy that may be the price the user pays for that responsiveness. Chalk is an elegant application allowing two people to share the same augmented view of the world. We can envision using it in the office or at home—to repair broken devices yourself, to consider how furniture might be rearranged, to assess fire damage with an insurance agent, to get an estimate of building repair from a contractor, and so on. As you wave the phone around, it creates a rudimentary digital double of the room for the purposes of anchoring the chalk mark. In the future, a successor application could be performing more sophisticated scene understanding to distinguish appliances, computers, machines, people and everything else the camera sees, and it could be sending that data up to the Cloud. </p>

        		<p class="white-text">We began this book with the Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station and argued against the myth that grew up around it. There is another received narrative about film—this one concerning its development as a medium in its first thirty or forty years. That narrative goes like this. The earliest filmmakers borrowed the conventions and practices of other media, particularly live drama. They had their actors perform in front of a stationary camera as if they were onstage. Gradually, filmmakers invented a new language of cinema, particularly by learning to move the camera and edit the film to exploit the unique power of film as a medium. Film was then liberated from its subservience to stage drama and allowed to fulfill its aesthetic destiny as a medium of visual storytelling. The addition of sound (and perhaps color photography) more or less perfected film as a medium. This idea that film had a single trajectory defined by its inner logic as a medium is as naive as the original La Ciotat myth. Mainstream cinema may have reached a kind of formal plateau in the 1930s or the 1950s. But there were always alternative styles, most obviously the achievements of avant-garde filmmakers from the 1920s to the present. </p>
